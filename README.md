# Chaos Engineering Toolkit Demo

This repository demonstrates the implementation of chaos engineering experiments using the Chaos Toolkit. The primary goal is to validate the resilience of our system under unexpected conditions.

## Hypothesis

"When a pod in the application's namespace is terminated, our service will automatically recover within a minute without any user disruption."

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Kubernetes (if targeting Kubernetes for the chaos experiments)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Ayotundepaul/chaos-eng.git
   cd chaos-engineering-toolkit-demo


(Recommended) Create a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install the required packages:

pip install chaostoolkit chaostoolkit-kubernetes


Running the Experiment

Execute the chaos experiment using:
chaos run experiment.json

Analysis

After executing the experiment, you can review the logs generated by the Chaos Toolkit to observe:

The steady-state hypothesis before and after running the experiment.
Actions taken to introduce chaos.
The system's behavior during the chaos injection.
